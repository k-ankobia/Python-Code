# Neural Network Self Driving Car

I Built a real-time autonomous navigation radio-controlled car by prototyping a platform to test machine learning algorithms through a combination of robotics controls and computer vision using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and suitable sensors. Python and C were used to pre-process and transform raw data sets from a video camera feed the car to the right level of granularity for analysis using neural networks to generate and test a model.
